# library_ssWi

This program is a basic test for the ssWi library (https://os.mbed.com/users/mariob/code/ssWi/) and to test how mbed Studio works
The main problem with the IDE is that I cannot commit and push changes to the library directly

Things to do:
- fix problem with different build profiles
- add timeout in hw requests
- improve diagnositc in main.cpp
